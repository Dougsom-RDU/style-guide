This guide includes:

* boilerplate text (content designed to have multiple applications) for statistical concepts
* definitions of commonly-used terms
* general guidance on formatting, grammar and punctuation

### Abbreviations and acronyms

Use the complete name or phrase followed by the abbreviation or acronym in the first instance: for example, ‘English Housing Survey (EHS)’. Thereafter, within each section, use the acronym alone: ‘EHS’.

Treat each section as a new instance of the name or phrase (because users may not read all the sections or read them in order).

Don’t follow a name or phrase with its acronym if you’re not going to use the acronym later in the text.

### Adults and young people

English law defines adults as people aged 18 and older, but some datasets count those aged 16 and older as adults. In these cases the commentary should refer to “people aged 16 and older” rather than “adults aged 16 and older”.

In criminal justice statistics, ‘young people’ are aged from 10 to 17 years.

### Age standardisation


For some measures (those related to illness, for example) statistical age standardisation is particularly important.

In these cases, use a plain English explanation in ‘Things you need to know’:

> These statistics have been age-standardised so comparisons can be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile (an age profile shows the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group). The statistics do not tell you the actual percentage of people in each ethnic group who [insert text relevant to measure here].


You can also use a more technical explanation in Methodology:

> The resulting statistics for [insert reference to what’s being measured] have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of [what’s being measured] is related to age and the age profile can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.

### BAME/BME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic/Black and minority ethnic)

Don’t use this alternative to ‘ethnic minorities’ because:

* the UK’s ethnic minorities include White ethnic minorities
* it highlights particular groups while others are omitted – for example, it includes Black and Asian people but not people of a Mixed ethnicity

### Bedroom standard

This is the the number of bedrooms needed to avoid undesirable sharing (based on the age, sex and relationship of household members).

For example, each married or cohabiting couple is allowed a bedroom, as is an individual aged 21 or over and each pair of adolescents or children of the same sex. The bedroom standard is described in detail in the 2015/16 [English Housing Survey Headline Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595785/2015-16_EHS_Headline_Report.pdf) (PDF).

### Broad ethnic groups

Where the results of a sample survey are only available for broad ethnic groups, the following caveat can be useful in ‘Things you need to know’:

> The ethnic groupings used here are broad; there is no breakdown of data for the more specific ethnic groups each contains. Some of the specific ethnic groups have very different experiences to one another. For example, the Black ethnic group could include both recent migrants from Somalia and Black people born in Britain to British parents.

### Capitalisation

Ethnic categories, including Asian, Black, Mixed, White and Other all take a capital. When referring generically to ‘all other ethnic groups’ (compared to the White British group, for example) use a lower ‘o’, but use a capital ‘O’ for for specific groupings like ‘Any Other Asian’ or ‘Any Other Black’.

### Census

Follow the ONS style guide and use upper case when referring to a specific census year: for example, ‘This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census’.

Use lower case in all other cases: for example, ‘the census information shows that...’

### Citations

Citations (example below) are acceptable in Methodology but not elsewhere.

> The achieved response rate (57%) is in line with that of similar surveys (Barnes et al. 2010; cited in APMS 2014).

### Compared with and compared to

Use ‘compared with’ when writing about the similarities and differences of subjects.

For example:

> 25% of White respondents felt they had an influence, compared with 44% of Black respondents

Use ‘in comparison with’, not ‘in comparison to’.

### Confidence intervals

Research showed that even data-literate users struggled to understand this important statistical concept when numbers were presented in a table or an explanation offered in commentary.

In Methodology, include a note like the following, customised for individual measures:

> Confidence intervals
>
> Confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the ‘download the data’ section.
>
> Based on the NCMP measurements, it’s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight or obese in England in 2015/16.
>
> The NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight or obese, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.
>
> It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds in England were overweight or obese in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.
>
>The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.

If the differences between 2 different groups or time periods are determined to be statistically significant using the non-overlapping confidence intervals method, see [Statistical significance determined by non-overlapping confidence intervals](#statistical-significance-determined-by-non-overlapping-confidence-intervals).

### Data

Follow the GDS style guide and treat data as a singular noun.

### Data versus statistics


Use data to refer to the raw material the measure draws on, and statistics to refer to findings and estimates. It might be useful to think of data as the clay and statistics as the pot.

### Data visualisation doesn’t match commentary


Charts can appear to show differences between ethnic groups which, for statistical reasons, aren’t meaningful or reliable findings.

However, simply ignoring them leaves users at best confused, and at worst suspicious.

Adapt one of the following and include in the main points:

> although the chart/table shows a difference in home ownership for under 35s, sample sizes for this group are small, so any generalisations based on this result are very unreliable

> there were no meaningful differences in the degree to which men and women in other ethnic groups felt their actions were worthwhile, because of the wide variation in responses for these groups

### Dates and date ranges

For financial or academic year date ranges use the format ‘2015/16’. Use the ‘What the data measures’ section to specify whether the measure spans an academic or financial year.

For combined years of data use the format ‘2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)’.

For a time period starting and ending with non-calendar years, format as ‘2009/10 to 2015/16’.

Preserve the formatting used for external publications: for example, ‘The English Housing Survey 2013-14’.

### Denominators and numerators

These are statistical terms that many users won’t understand. Keep them for use in the Methodology, where needed.

A plain English explanation of who’s counted in the numerator and denominator might look like this:

> The data shows the percentage of defendants who were found guilty of a certain offence within a given year. This was calculated by dividing the number of defendants found guilty of the offence by the total number of people who were prosecuted for that offence that year, then multiplying by 100.

### Denominators and numerators in charts and tables

Data analysts will usually choose which values to include in a table.

Check that column header rows are clear and unambiguous – for example, they should say ‘All respondents’ rather than ‘Respondents’ if they’re referring to survey data.

### Difference/discrimination

We avoid subjective judgements about the causes of different outcomes or experiences for ethnic groups, which may or may not be due to discrimination.

For this reason, we refer to ethnic ‘difference’ (or ‘disparity’) not ethnic discrimination. An obvious exception would be measures discussing discrimination cases in law.

### Double, treble/triple, quadruple

‘Double’ or ‘twice’ are acceptable. Use ‘3 times’ or ‘4 times’ instead of triple/treble/thrice or quadruple.

### Dwelling

When this term is used in measures, include the following definition in ‘What the data measures’:

> A dwelling is normally a house or flat. It is self-contained and all the rooms and amenities, such as kitchen, bathroom and toilet, are only for the use of the household living in it.

### Economically inactive

Use the following boilerplate in ‘What the data measures’ if you need to define ‘economically inactive’:

> A person of working age is counted as economically inactive if:
>
> * they are out of work
> * they have not been actively looking for work in the past 4 weeks
> * they are not waiting to start a job
>
> People who are caring for their family or retired are also counted as economically inactive.


### Ethnicity unknown

When data includes people for whom ethnicity is unknown, analysts will usually follow the department’s lead in including or excluding them from charts, tables and downloads.

Where it’s appropriate, include details about the group (for example its size) in ‘Things you need to know’.

### Ethnic minorities and ‘people from ethnic minority groups’

When White British people are compared to all other ethnic groups, these groups can collectively be referred to as ‘ethnic minorities’ or ‘people from ethnic minority groups’.

Avoid using either term as a synonym for Black, Asian, Mixed, etc – ethnic minorities include White ethnic minorities.

### Ethnic categories

Although there is no standardised list of ethnic categories used across the public sector, the following are the most common. Use the text below to explain the ethnic categories used in the measure.

To save space, longer descriptions should be shortened in charts, tables and commentary (for example, use ‘Black’ instead of ‘Black/African/Caribbean/Black British’).

18 ethnic categories:

> This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census.
>
> White:
>
> * English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British
> * Irish
> * Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller
> * Any Other White background
>
> Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups:
>
> * White and Black Caribbean
> * White and Black African
> * White and Asian
> * Any Other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background
>
> Asian/Asian British:
>
> * Indian
> * Pakistani
> * Bangladeshi
> * Chinese
> * Any Other Asian background
>
> Black/African/Caribbean/Black British:
>
> * African
> * Caribbean
> * Any Other Black/African/Caribbean background
>
> Other ethnic group:
>
> * Arab
> * Any Other ethnic group

16 ethnic categories:

> The 16 categories used in this data are those listed in the 2001 Census. The categories are
> broadly the same as those used in the 2011 Census, with the following exceptions:
>
> * the 2001 Census categorised Chinese people within 'Other ethnic group'.
> * the 2001 Census did not list Gypsy and Irish Travellers or Arab people.
>
> The 2001 categories are therefore as follows:
>
> White:
>
> * English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British
> * Irish
> * Any Other White background
>
> Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups:
>
> * White and Black Caribbean
> * White and Black African
> * White and Asian
> * Any Other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background
>
> Asian/Asian British:
>
> * Indian
> * Pakistani
> * Bangladeshi
> * Any Other Asian background
>
> Black/African/Caribbean/Black British:
>
> * African
> * Caribbean
> * Any Other Black/ African/ Caribbean background
>
> Other ethnic group:
>
> * Chinese
> * Any Other ethnic group

5 ethnic categories:

> For this data, the number of people surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm
> conclusions about specific ethnic categories. Therefore, the data is broken down into the
> following 5 broad groups:
>
> * Asian/Asian British
> * Black/African/Caribbean/Black British
> * Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups
> * White
> * Other ethnic group

2 ethnic categories:

> For this data, the number of people surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific or broad ethnic categories. Therefore, the data is broken down into the following 2 broad categories:

(either)

> * White British
> * Other – all other ethnic groups (including White ethnic minorities and all other ethnic minorities)

(or)

> * White – White ethnic groups (including White British and White ethnic minorities)
> * Other – all other ethnic minorities

In commentary, where White includes White British and White ethnic minorities, be specific about this in the first instance and use ‘the White ethnic group’ or ‘White people’ thereafter.

### Fractions

Use only meaningful fractions (a quarter, a half, three-quarters, one-third, one-fifth and one tenth) and write them out rather than expressing them numerically (not ½, ¾ etc). See the [ONS style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/numbers/#fractions) for further guidance.

### Free school meals (FSM)

In commentary:

> Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see Methodology.

In Methodology:

> Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive free school meals, not only those who actually received free school meals. Pupils not eligible for free school meals or unclassified pupils are described as ‘All other pupils’.

Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a [qualifying benefit.](https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals).

FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage. However, not all eligible parents apply for FSM and families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.

### Gender vs sex

Use the same term that’s used in the data source.

### Geographic coverage


Use ‘England, Wales and Scotland’, not Great Britain. ‘United Kingdom’ can be abbreviated to UK.

### Household

Use the following plain English definition:

> A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.

### Household reference person

Use the following plain English definition:

> The household reference person is the person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation.
>
> Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds; in these circumstances, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person to define the ethnic background of the household.

### Individuals vs occurrences

Adapt the following for ‘What the data measures’ if the measure counts occurrences rather than individuals:

> This data records the number of occasions on which (an act of self-harm was reported), not the number of individuals that (self-harmed), nor how often (individual young people harmed themselves). Individuals may therefore be included in the data more than once. This means that the (rate or percentage the measure is looking at) should be considered with some caution.

### Levels


Acceptable when used in the source material: for example, ‘levels of satisfaction’. Avoid as a synonym for percentage or proportion (in other words, don’t replace ‘percentage of homeowners’ with ‘levels of home ownership’).

### Likely to

‘More likely to’ and ‘less likely to’ are easily understood ways to explain outcomes for a ethnic group that were originally expressed as rates or percentages.

This statement:

> 87% of White men with level 4 qualifications or above were employed in 2016, compared to 82% of Asian men with level 4 qualifications or above.

could be rephrased as:

> In 2016, White men with level 4 qualifications were more likely to be employed than Asian men with these qualifications.

'Likelihood' is an acceptable alternative:

> In 2016, there was a greater likelihood White men with level 4 qualifications would be employed than Asian men with these qualifications.

However, be careful with either of these formulations in contexts where they could be interpreted as disparaging to individual members of a group.

This statement:

> White NHS staff were less likely to enter the disciplinary process than staff from other ethnic groups.

Would be better phrased as:

> 1% of White staff and 2% of staff from the other ethnic groups entered the disciplinary process.

### Linking to PDFs

Links to a downloadable pdf should be clearly labelled (PDF). For example:

> This is consistent with DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality (PDF).

### Maintained schools

Avoid. Use ‘state-funded mainstream schools’ instead.

### Major race groups


Avoid this phrasing. Use 'broad ethnic groups' instead. (The website collects data on ethnicity, not race, and the terms ‘major’ and ‘race’ are both potentially inflammatory.)

### Males and females

Avoid unless you’re using ‘male’ or ‘female’ as an adjective, for example ‘10% of male offenders’.

Use men and women, young men and young women, boys and girls instead.

If the sample includes both adults and children, say, for example, ‘10% of Black men and boys’.

### Median

Use the following if you need to explain the median:

> The middle point of a range of numbers that are arranged in order of size from lowest to highest.

### Minor race groups


Avoid this phrasing. Use ‘specific ethnic groups' instead. (The website collects data on ethnicity, not race, and the terms ‘major’ and ‘race’ are both potentially inflammatory.)


### Non-White

Avoid saying ‘non-white’. Defining ethnic groups in relation to the White majority suggests they are of secondary importance. Use ‘ethnic minority groups (except White ethnic minorities)’.

### NS-SEC


Avoid both ‘National Statistics Socio-economic Classification’ and its abbreviation NS-SEC. Use ‘socio-economic groups’ and include the following boilerplate content in Methodology:

> The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) categorises members of the adult public in the UK according to their occupational status.
>
> The NS-SEC categories are:
>
> * managerial and professional occupations
> * intermediate occupations (clerical, sales, service)
> * routine and manual occupations
> * never worked and long-term unemployed
> * full-time students
> * not classified

### Numbers in commentary


Use sparingly. Referring to some of the figures in the chart or table helps users decipher them. Referring to lots of them makes the commentary indigestible.

Choose a way to present the data, and stick to it; for example, use fractions or percentages, but not both in the same measure. Avoid overloading commentary by stacking up every possible way of expressing the numbers.

Bad example:

> 51,218 HRPs who identified as Other White (around a quarter, or 25%) were in single person households, compared with 43,746 (2 in 5, or 40%) of those who identified as Irish.

Good example:

> 25% of Other White household representative people (HRPs) lived in single person households, compared with 40% of Irish.

Denominators are useful for context, but need only appear once.

Bad example:

> In 2015/16, there were 540,689 pupils at the end of key stage 4. Of pupils at the end of key stage 4 whose ethnicity was known (534,918 pupils), 79.0%  were White (422,763 pupils), 9.6% were Asian (51,218 pupils), 5.2% were Black (27,924 pupils), 4.3% were Mixed (22,868 pupils), 0.4% were Chinese (2,026 pupils) and 1.5% were any other ethnic group (8,119 pupils).

Good example:

> * in 2015/16, there were 540,689 pupils in key stage 4 at maintained schools in England, with ethnicity known for 534,918 (99%)
> * 78% were White, 9% were Asian, 5% were Black, 4% were Mixed, 1.5% came from the Other ethnic group and 0.4% were Chinese

### Only


Avoid this value judgment when describing findings. For example, don’t say ‘Asian pupils only scored X’.

### Other


This term has several uses.

It appears in lists of ethnic categories to describe anyone not falling into the first 4 categories:

* Asian
* Black
* Mixed
* White
* Other

(In commentary text, write, ‘people from the Other ethnic group’.)

‘Other’ is also used to describe people within a broad group not otherwise categorised, such as in the following:

> Asian/Asian British:
>
> * Indian
> * Pakistani
> * Bangladeshi
> * Chinese
> * Any Other Asian background

(In commentary text, write, ‘people from the Other Asian ethnic group’.)

‘Other’ also appears in charts and tables using binary ethnic categorisation:

> * White
* Other

(In commentary text, write ‘people from other ethnic groups’ – because in this case it doesn’t refer to an ethnic categorisation, but simply everyone who isn’t White.)

‘Other Black’ and ‘Black other’:
Charts and tables use the formulation ‘Black other’ because it makes the grouping of Black ethnic categories easier for users to read. In commentary, use ‘Other Black’.

### Overcrowding

Define this term in measures by including the following definition in ‘What the data measures’:

> Overcrowding is measured using the bedroom standard. A household is counted as overcrowded if it has fewer bedrooms than it needs according to the bedroom standard.

### Percentage

When expressing numbers, use the symbol (%) in text, not the word ‘percent’ (for example, 75%). The word percentage can be used in commentary (for example, ‘a higher percentage of girls than boys entered the Ebacc’).

Gaps should be expressed as a percentage point difference, like this:

> Black Caribbean pupils showed the biggest difference between boys and girls, at 16 percentage points: 44% of girls entered the Ebacc, while 28% of boys did so

Not like this:

> 16% more Black Caribbean girls entered the Ebacc than Black Caribbean boys

### Privately rented housing

Use the following boilerplate in 'What the data measures' if you need to define privately rented housing:

> Privately rented housing covers property which is not rented from local authorities (including Arms’ Length Management Organisations and housing action trusts), housing associations, local housing companies, co-operatives and charitable trusts.

The private rented sector also includes accommodation that is tied to a job or made available rent-free.

### Proportion vs percentage

Percent means out of 100, proportion means out of 1 (that is, a fraction of the total).

Percentage:

> I drank 25% of the water in the glass.

Proportion:

> I drank a quarter of the water in the glass.

Many people use these words interchangeably. Be consistent in usage within a sentence  that is, don’t combine proportion and percentage in one bullet.

### Race


Use ‘ethnicity’ instead because surveys usually ask respondents for their ethnicity not their race, and using consistent terminology helps users understand the content.

### Rate


Some measures use rate (or ratio) while others use percentage.

Rate:

> Self-harm incidents per 1,000 prisoners by ethnicity

Percentage:

> Percentage of prisoners self-harming, by ethnicity

In a sentence, write ‘Rates of self-harm for prisoners increased for the prison population in general during the period measured’.

Rate is synonymous with ratio. Don’t confuse either of them with percentage or proportion.

There are some exceptions. In measures relating to employment, for example, the term ‘unemployment rate’ is used to indicate the number of people in employment as a percentage of the working age population. Therefore, you could express a finding as follows:

> since 2004, employment has gone up across all ethnic groups, with the highest rate of employment at 74% (around 29.5 million people in employment) in 2016

### Region


Use ‘area’ for titles of summaries, graphs and tables (user testing showed ‘region’ was often misread as ‘religion’).

Region is acceptable in commentary text. Header rows in tables will usually refer to the specific type of geography being studied, for example ‘Local authority’.

England’s 9 regions take capital letters:

* the East of England
* the East Midlands
* London
* the North East
* the North West
* the South East
* the South West
* the West Midlands
* Yorkshire and the Humber

### Rounding


A data analyst will decide whether to round to whole numbers or 1 decimal place. They should explain their approach in the commentary template.

Rounding must be consistent within a measure, so use the same rounding in commentary that’s being used in charts and tables.

In cases where rounding has been used, add the boilerplate text below to the ‘Rounding’ field to explain inconsistencies:

> We round numbers in our commentary. For this reason some figures may not add up, and numbers quoted in commentary may not exactly match numbers in charts and tables.

### Sample size

Sample size affects the reliability of the data in different circumstances. Don’t assume users understand what the term means.

Use the following plain English explanation in ‘The ethnic categories used in this data’:

> For this data, the number of people from specific ethnic categories surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm conclusions. Therefore, the data is broken down into the following 5 broad groups:

Where small sample sizes have affected the reliability of the data, use the following boilerplate caveat in ‘Things you need to know’:

> Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.

You can also adapt this sentence to explain the difference between the sample population and the entire population:

> In this case, the survey is based on a sample of 5 year olds in school whose parents allowed them to take part, rather than all 5 year olds in England.

Within bullet points, use the following text (adapted to other ethnic groups with small sample sizes as necessary):

> for the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group, the numbers of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions

You can also use the following where results over time are affected by small sample sizes:

> Results taken from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data, especially for sub-groups (for example, a specific ethnic group, age group and gender).’

### Social housing

Use the following boilerplate in ‘What the data measures’ if you need to define social housing:

> Social housing includes property rented from local authorities (including Arms’ Length Management Organisations and housing action trusts), housing associations, local housing companies, co-operatives and charitable trusts.

### Statistical significance

Specialists understand ‘not statistically significant’ to mean, ‘failing to meet a variety of statistical tests’. But for general users it begs more questions than it answers: for example, ‘Why are these results relating to my ethnic group, and the visible differences between my group and other groups, not regarded as important?’

For this reason, we’ve been careful to explain statistical significance whenever we use it. Particularly, we try to offer a reason *why* data is ‘not statistically significant’.

Bad example:

> The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a sample survey so it is possible that some of the disparities observed have occurred purely by chance. We use robust statistical methods to carry out the EHS. As a result, we can identify statistically significant differences, that is, variations which have not occurred purely by chance. Unless specified otherwise, all the differences reported in the main points below are statistically significant.

Good example:

> The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about the total population.
>
> The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.
>
> Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.’

In Summaries and Main points, we use a shorter version. See the style guide entries on ‘Sample size’ and ‘Variance’ for ways to explain unreliable data in plain English.

### Statistical significance determined by non-overlapping confidence intervals

For some measures statistical significance has been determined using non-overlapping confidence intervals. The confidence interval for each group is the percentage range between its lower and upper bounds or limits. If confidence intervals for 2 groups or time periods don’t overlap – that is, if the range of results for the 2 groups are exclusive of one another – then the differences are statistically significant.

This should be expressed differently in 2 places in the measure:

In ‘Things you need to know’:

> Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.
>
> Differences are statistically significant if the results for the 2 groups or time periods being compared are within entirely different ranges.

In Methodology:

> Observed differences are considered statistically significant when the 95% confidence intervals for 2 groups don't overlap.

An example of non-overlapping confidence intervals would be where the results for one ethnic group fell between a lower confidence limit of 72.3% and an upper confidence limit of 76.4%, and another’s were between 68.1% and 69.2%.

### Statistical tests

The design of some surveys mean tests can’t be carried out for statistical significance, yet the results are still meaningful. The following boilerplate can be adapted for these circumstances:

> To increase the reliability of the data, which is taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) combines data for each year into a 3-year average. This process continues over a series of overlapping 3-year periods.

This type of survey methodology means that some statistical tests for significant differences between ethnic groups have not been carried out. However, commentary has been supplied for those findings where differences between ethnic groups are reasonably reliable.

### Suppression and disclosure


Explain these concepts, where they are applicable.

For data suppressed or not disclosed to preserve confidentiality, adapt the following and include in ‘Things you need to know’:

> The Department for Education (DfE) has excluded, or ‘suppressed’, very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular standard).
This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality.

For data suppressed or not disclosed because of small sample size, adapt the following:

> Data for some Muslim and Sikh schools was not included in these statistics, because the small numbers of pupils make it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about their attainment.

If there’s only suppression in some dimensions in a measure, you can adapt the following:

> It is not possible to look in detail at (the characteristics of the type of households with damp problems). This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics such as (income, socio-economic group, region or age) are not large enough to give reliable estimates.’

### Survey uncertainty

Use the following plain English boilerplate in ‘Things you need to know’:

>These statistics are estimates based on the sample of people who took part in the survey, and may not reflect the whole population. You should therefore use caution when interpreting them.

### Time series

When data extends over a time series of 3 or more years, or 3 or more data points, add the following caveat to 'Things you need to know':

> Bear in mind that the trends shown in the data may not extend beyond the time series of this analysis.

### Total household income


Total household income is a metric frequently used in housing measures. Use the following explanation of the concept in the Methodology section:

> Total household income is the combined income of all members of the household. It includes income from all sources including earnings from employment and self-employment, pensions (both state and private), benefits and tax credits, interest from savings and investments, maintenance, student grants and rent payments received.
>
> Due to the nature of the question, some respondents gave insufficient information to classify their household income or declined to answer the question.
>
> Those cases with insufficient information may include respondents who did not know the income of other household members.
>
> Income is banded as follows:
>
> - Less than £10,000
> - £10,000 to less than £20,000
> - £20,000 to less than £30,000
> - £30,000 to less than £40,000
> - £40,000 to less than £50,000
> - £50,000 or more
> - No income stated or not enough information provided’

### Trends across time series


Uncertainty around results based on small sample sizes is reduced if the results are consistent over a number of years. Use the following boilerplate:

> Where ethnic groups have consistently low or high scores over several survey years, this can somewhat offset the uncertainty around survey estimates from one year.

### Under-occupation

Under-occupation is measured using the bedroom standard (see ‘Bedroom standard’ in this guidance). A household is counted as under-occupied if it has at least 2 bedrooms more than it needs according to the bedroom standard.

### Unemployment

Use the following boilerplate in 'What the data measures' if you need to define unemployment:

> A person is counted as unemployed if all 3 of the following apply:
>
> * they are out of work
> * they are available to start work in the next 2 weeks
> * they have either been actively looking for work in the past 4 weeks or have found a job and are waiting to start it
>
> This is the International Labour Organisation’s definition of ‘unemployment’ and is often used in published UK statistics. It gives more accurate figures for unemployment than alternatives such as a count of claimants for out-of-work benefits.

### Variance

Explain survey results which are unreliable due to variance by adapting the following boilerplate:

> Respondents answered the question ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?’ on a scale of 0 to 10. Where an average result for the ethnic group studied is based on a small range of answers (for example, life satisfaction between 6 and 8 out of 10) we can be fairly confident about that survey estimate.
>
> However, when the average result is based on a wide variation in answers (for example, life satisfaction between 4 and 9 out of 10) we can be much less certain of the reliability of the survey estimate. Where no commentary has been supplied for trends or differences apparently visible in the charts and tables, it’s because this wide variation (known as ‘variance’) makes them unreliable.

### Volatility


Use ‘variable’ instead of ‘volatile’, or avoid both terms, as in the following:

Original:

> Data on Gypsy or Irish Traveller respondents exhibit volatility due to the small sample size, and therefore should be treated with caution

Rewrite:

> For the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group, the number of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions.

### Weighting


If data hasn’t been weighted, this information should be included in ‘Things you need to know’.

Otherwise, it can be explained in Methodology.

For a national survey:

> Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.
>
> For example, a survey which contains 25% women and 75% men will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know has an even 50/50 split.
>
> Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable.
>
> Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.’

For a specifically targeted survey, use the following instead:

> Surveys seek information about a particular group of people – we call this the target population.
>
> Every target population will have a particular age and gender profile – for example, teachers are predominantly female and under 50. Some target populations will also have a regional profile – for example, they might be clustered in a particular part of the country.
>
> Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population.
>
> For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.
>
> Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions.

### White British

See ‘2 ethnic categories’ in this guide.

### Working age

‘Working age’ usually includes everyone aged 16 to 64 years.

### Worst


Avoid value judgements.

Bad example:

> Gypsy/Roma pupils did worst.

Good example:

> Gypsy/Roma pupils were least likely to meet the expected standards.

### X axis and Y axis

Check that the titles of charts and tables are descriptive enough that X and Y axis labels aren’t needed.
