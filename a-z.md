### Abbreviations and acronyms

Follow the [GOV.UK style guide on abbreviations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#abbreviations-and-acronyms).

### Ages

Use conversational language when talking about ages.

For example:

* ‘16 to 64 year olds’, not ‘people aged 16 to 64 years’
* ‘5 year olds’, not ‘children aged 5 years old’
* ‘under 18s’, not ‘people aged 17 and under’

There are some exceptions. For example, say ‘people aged 65 and over’, not ‘over 64s’.

### Averages

Don’t use ‘mean’ or ‘median’ in bullet points. Say ‘average’ instead.

You can explain the type of average used in methodology.

Plain English version of median:

> The middle point of a range of numbers arranged in order.

Plain English version of mean: 

> The sum of all the numbers, divided by how many numbers there are.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="b" class="atoz-section">B</h2>

### BAME/BME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic/Black and minority ethnic)

See [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

### Broad and specific ethnic groups

See [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

### Bullet points

In most cases, follow [GOV.UK guidance on bullet points](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#bullet-points-steps).

There’s one exception. Don’t add a lead-in line above the bullet points in ‘Main facts and figures’. 

See also [Writing principles](#).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="c" class="atoz-section">C</h2>

### Capitalisation

Follow the [GOV.UK guidance on capitalisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#capitalisation). 

See also [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

### Census

A population census happens every 10 years in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Write ‘Census’ with a capital ‘C’ when you’re referring to a specific census. 

For example:

* according to the 2011 Census, the total population of England and Wales was 56.1 million

Use lower case:

* when you’re not referring to a specific census – for example, ‘census information shows that…’
* for the ‘school census’ 

### Comparisons

Don’t write ‘compared to’.

Write ‘compared with’ when you’re comparing groups with each other.

For example:

> from 2017 to 2018, there were 3 stop and searches for every 1,000 White people, compared with 29 stop and searches for every 1,000 Black people

### Confidence intervals

Use this in the Methodology section:

> [Download the data](#download-the-data) to see the confidence intervals for the estimates on this page.

> Read more about how confidence intervals are used to judge the reliability of survey data.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="d" class="atoz-section">D</h2>

### Data

Follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#data) and write data as a singular noun.

For example:

‘This data shows that…’, not ‘These data show that…’.

### Dates

Follow [GOV.UK’s style guide on dates](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates). Say ‘2018 to 2019’, not ‘2018/19’ or ‘2018-19’.  

Dashes (-) and slashes (/) make it harder for users to read and don’t work well for those who use screen readers.

#### Financial or academic years 

Let users know if you’re referring to a date range other than a calendar year: 

* The financial year ending March 2019
* The academic year ending July 2019
* The tax year 2017 to 2018

Example:

> there were 277,378 stop and search incidents in England and Wales in the financial year ending March 2018, at a rate of 5 per 1,000 people

#### Combining data across multiple years

Don’t refer to ‘rolling averages’.

Use or adapt one of the following:

* 3 years ending March 2019 (combined)
* In the 5 years ending August 2019, an average of...
* On average for 2017 and 2018 combined, …

Example:

> in the 2 years ending March 2017, an average of 3.9 million (17%) of the estimated 23 million households in England rented social housing

#### Periods over time

Don’t write ‘2002/03 to 2018/19’.

Use or adapt one of the following:

* 2002 to 2018
* 10 academic years ending August 2019
* Financial years ending March 2003 to March 2019


### Decimals

See [rounding](#).

### Denominators and numerators

Don’t refer to ‘numerators’ or ‘denominators’ except in data download files.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="e" class="atoz-section">E</h2>

### Economically inactive

Someone is economically inactive if they are 16 to 64 years old and:

* are out of work
* have not been looking for work in the past 4 weeks
* are not waiting to start a job

This could include people who care for their family or are retired. 

### Ethnic minorities

See [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

### Ethnicities and nationalities

See [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

### Ethnicity facts and figures

Write ‘Ethnicity facts and figures’, not ‘Ethnicity Facts and Figures’ or ‘ethnicity facts and figures’.  

This includes within a sentence. For example, ‘New data was recently added to Ethnicity facts and figures.’

Don’t use the abbreviations ‘EFF’ or ‘EFAF’. Either say ‘Ethnicity facts and figures’ or ‘the website’, depending on the context. Don’t call it a ‘service’.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="f" class="atoz-section">F</h2>

### Fractions

Only use meaningful fractions such as a quarter, a half, three-quarters or one-third. Follow the [ONS guidance](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/numbers/#fractions) by writing them out rather than expressing numerically (not ½ or ¾).

### Free school meals (FSM)

Follow the [GOV.UK style guide on abbreviations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#abbreviations-and-acronyms) before using ‘FSM’.

All children in reception, year 1 and year 2 at state-funded schools get free school meals.

But eligibility for free school meals is also used as an indicator of deprivation.

Add this content to dimension summaries, above the bullet points:

> The Department for Education uses eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as an indicator of deprivation.

Add this content to the Methodology section:

> Figures for free school meals include pupils who are eligible for FSM. To be eligible, their families must:

> * have applied for FSM at the time of the school census in January
> * be receiving a qualifying benefit like Jobseeker’s Allowance

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="g" class="atoz-section">G</h2>

### Gender vs sex

Use the same term as in the data source. The ONS explains [the difference between the two terms](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/whatisthedifferencebetweensexandgender/2019-02-21).

See also [women and men](#).

### Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ethnic groups

See [Writing about ethnicity](writing-about-ethnicity).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="h" class="atoz-section">H</h2>

### Household

Plain English version of household:

> A household is a person or group of people whose accommodation is their main home. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and a living room, sitting room or dining area.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="l" class="atoz-section">L</h2>

### Levels

Acceptable when used in the source material: for example, ‘levels of satisfaction’. Avoid as a synonym for percentage or proportion (in other words, don’t replace ‘percentage of homeowners’ with ‘levels of home ownership’).

### Likely to

‘More likely to’ and ‘less likely to’ are easily understood ways to explain outcomes for a ethnic group that were originally expressed as rates or percentages.

This statement:

> 87% of White men with level 4 qualifications or above were employed in 2016, compared to 82% of Asian men with level 4 qualifications or above.

could be rephrased as:

> In 2016, White men with level 4 qualifications were more likely to be employed than Asian men with these qualifications.

'Likelihood' is an acceptable alternative:

> In 2016, there was a greater likelihood White men with level 4 qualifications would be employed than Asian men with these qualifications.

However, be careful with either of these formulations in contexts where they could be interpreted as disparaging to individual members of a group.

This statement:

> White NHS staff were less likely to enter the disciplinary process than staff from other ethnic groups.

Would be better phrased as:

> 1% of White staff and 2% of staff from the other ethnic groups entered the disciplinary process.

### Linking to PDFs

Links to a downloadable pdf should be clearly labelled (PDF). For example:

> This is consistent with DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality (PDF).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="m" class="atoz-section">M</h2>

### Maintained schools

Avoid. Use ‘state-funded mainstream schools’ instead.

### Males and females

Avoid unless you’re using ‘male’ or ‘female’ as an adjective, for example ‘10% of male offenders’.

Use men and women, young men and young women, boys and girls instead.

If the sample includes both adults and children, say, for example, ‘10% of Black men and boys’.

### Mean

See [averages](#).

### Median

Use the following if you need to explain the median:

> The middle point of a range of numbers that are arranged in order of size from lowest to highest.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="n" class="atoz-section">N</h2>

### Mixed ethnicity

See [Writing about ethnicity](#).

### Non-White

Avoid saying ‘non-white’. Defining ethnic groups in relation to the White majority suggests they are of secondary importance. Use ‘ethnic minority groups (except White ethnic minorities)’.

### NS-SEC

Avoid both ‘National Statistics Socio-economic Classification’ and its abbreviation NS-SEC. Use ‘socio-economic groups’ and include the following boilerplate content in Methodology:

> The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) categorises members of the adult public in the UK according to their occupational status.
>
> The NS-SEC categories are:
>
> * managerial and professional occupations
> * intermediate occupations (clerical, sales, service)
> * routine and manual occupations
> * never worked and long-term unemployed
> * full-time students
> * not classified

### Numbers in commentary

Use sparingly. Referring to some of the figures in the chart or table helps users decipher them. Referring to lots of them makes the commentary indigestible.

Choose a way to present the data, and stick to it; for example, use fractions or percentages, but not both in the same measure. Avoid overloading commentary by stacking up every possible way of expressing the numbers.

Bad example:

> 51,218 HRPs who identified as Other White (around a quarter, or 25%) were in single person households, compared with 43,746 (2 in 5, or 40%) of those who identified as Irish.

Good example:

> 25% of Other White household representative people (HRPs) lived in single person households, compared with 40% of Irish.

Denominators are useful for context, but need only appear once.

Bad example:

> In 2015/16, there were 540,689 pupils at the end of key stage 4. Of pupils at the end of key stage 4 whose ethnicity was known (534,918 pupils), 79.0%  were White (422,763 pupils), 9.6% were Asian (51,218 pupils), 5.2% were Black (27,924 pupils), 4.3% were Mixed (22,868 pupils), 0.4% were Chinese (2,026 pupils) and 1.5% were any other ethnic group (8,119 pupils).

Good example:

> * in 2015/16, there were 540,689 pupils in key stage 4 at maintained schools in England, with ethnicity known for 534,918 (99%)
> * 78% were White, 9% were Asian, 5% were Black, 4% were Mixed, 1.5% came from the Other ethnic group and 0.4% were Chinese

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="o" class="atoz-section">O</h2>

### Only

Avoid this value judgment when describing findings. For example, don’t say ‘Asian pupils only scored X’.

### Other

This term has several uses.

It appears in lists of ethnic categories to describe anyone not falling into the first 4 categories:

* Asian
* Black
* Mixed
* White
* Other

(In commentary text, write, ‘people from the Other ethnic group’.)

‘Other’ is also used to describe people within a broad group not otherwise categorised, such as in the following:

> Asian/Asian British:
>
> * Indian
> * Pakistani
> * Bangladeshi
> * Chinese
> * Any Other Asian background

(In commentary text, write, ‘people from the Other Asian ethnic group’.)

‘Other’ also appears in charts and tables using binary ethnic categorisation:

> * White
* Other

(In commentary text, write ‘people from other ethnic groups’ – because in this case it doesn’t refer to an ethnic categorisation, but simply everyone who isn’t White.)

‘Other Black’ and ‘Black other’:
Charts and tables use the formulation ‘Black other’ because it makes the grouping of Black ethnic categories easier for users to read. In commentary, use ‘Other Black’.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="p" class="atoz-section">P</h2>

### Percentage

When expressing numbers, use the symbol (%) in text, not the word ‘percent’ (for example, 75%). The word percentage can be used in commentary (for example, ‘a higher percentage of girls than boys entered the Ebacc’).

Gaps should be expressed as a percentage point difference, like this:

> Black Caribbean pupils showed the biggest difference between boys and girls, at 16 percentage points: 44% of girls entered the Ebacc, while 28% of boys did so

Not like this:

> 16% more Black Caribbean girls entered the Ebacc than Black Caribbean boys

### Proportion vs percentage

Percent means out of 100, proportion means out of 1 (that is, a fraction of the total).

Percentage:

> I drank 25% of the water in the glass.

Proportion:

> I drank a quarter of the water in the glass.

Many people use these words interchangeably. Be consistent in usage within a sentence  that is, don’t combine proportion and percentage in one bullet.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="r" class="atoz-section">R</h2>

### Race

Use ‘ethnicity’ instead because surveys usually ask respondents for their ethnicity not their race, and using consistent terminology helps users understand the content.

### Race Disparity Audit

The [Race Disparity Audit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/race-disparity-audit) was published on GOV.UK in October 2017.

It’s a standalone publication, and not the same as the Ethnicity facts and figures website.

If you need to refer to it, write ‘the Race Disparity Audit’, not ‘the race disparity audit’. In subsequent mentions, you can say ‘the audit’ (but not ‘the Audit’ or ‘the RDA’).

### Race Disparity Unit

Write ‘the Race Disparity Unit’, not ‘the Race disparity unit’ or ‘the race disparity unit’. 

It’s fine to say ‘the RDU’, but write it out in full the first time you say it, as per the [GOV.UK style guide on abbreviations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#abbreviations-and-acronyms).

### Rate

Some measures use rate (or ratio) while others use percentage.

Rate:

> Self-harm incidents per 1,000 prisoners by ethnicity

Percentage:

> Percentage of prisoners self-harming, by ethnicity

In a sentence, write ‘Rates of self-harm for prisoners increased for the prison population in general during the period measured’.

Rate is synonymous with ratio. Don’t confuse either of them with percentage or proportion.

There are some exceptions. In measures relating to employment, for example, the term ‘unemployment rate’ is used to indicate the number of people in employment as a percentage of the working age population. Therefore, you could express a finding as follows:

> since 2004, employment has gone up across all ethnic groups, with the highest rate of employment at 74% (around 29.5 million people in employment) in 2016

### Region

Use ‘area’ for titles of summaries, graphs and tables (user testing showed ‘region’ was often misread as ‘religion’).

Region is acceptable in commentary text. Header rows in tables will usually refer to the specific type of geography being studied, for example ‘Local authority’.

England’s 9 regions take capital letters:

* the East of England
* the East Midlands
* London
* the North East
* the North West
* the South East
* the South West
* the West Midlands
* Yorkshire and the Humber

### Rounding

A data analyst will decide whether to round to whole numbers or 1 decimal place. They should explain their approach in the commentary template.

Rounding must be consistent within a measure, so use the same rounding in commentary that’s being used in charts and tables.

In cases where rounding has been used, add the boilerplate text below to the ‘Rounding’ field to explain inconsistencies:

> We round numbers in our commentary. For this reason some figures may not add up, and numbers quoted in commentary may not exactly match numbers in charts and tables.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="s" class="atoz-section">S</h2>

### Sample size

Sample size affects the reliability of the data in different circumstances. Don’t assume users understand what the term means.

Use the following plain English explanation in ‘The ethnic categories used in this data’:

> For this data, the number of people from specific ethnic categories surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm conclusions. Therefore, the data is broken down into the following 5 broad groups:

Where small sample sizes have affected the reliability of the data, use the following boilerplate caveat in ‘Things you need to know’:

> Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.

You can also adapt this sentence to explain the difference between the sample population and the entire population:

> In this case, the survey is based on a sample of 5 year olds in school whose parents allowed them to take part, rather than all 5 year olds in England.

Within bullet points, use the following text (adapted to other ethnic groups with small sample sizes as necessary):

> for the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group, the numbers of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions

You can also use the following where results over time are affected by small sample sizes:

> Results taken from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data, especially for sub-groups (for example, a specific ethnic group, age group and gender).’

### Statistical significance

Specialists understand ‘not statistically significant’ to mean, ‘failing to meet a variety of statistical tests’. But for general users it begs more questions than it answers: for example, ‘Why are these results relating to my ethnic group, and the visible differences between my group and other groups, not regarded as important?’

For this reason, we’ve been careful to explain statistical significance whenever we use it. Particularly, we try to offer a reason *why* data is ‘not statistically significant’.

Bad example:

> The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a sample survey so it is possible that some of the disparities observed have occurred purely by chance. We use robust statistical methods to carry out the EHS. As a result, we can identify statistically significant differences, that is, variations which have not occurred purely by chance. Unless specified otherwise, all the differences reported in the main points below are statistically significant.

Good example:

> The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about the total population.
>
> The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.
>
> Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.’

In Summaries and Main points, we use a shorter version. See the style guide entries on ‘Sample size’ and ‘Variance’ for ways to explain unreliable data in plain English.

### Statistical significance determined by non-overlapping confidence intervals

For some measures statistical significance has been determined using non-overlapping confidence intervals. The confidence interval for each group is the percentage range between its lower and upper bounds or limits. If confidence intervals for 2 groups or time periods don’t overlap – that is, if the range of results for the 2 groups are exclusive of one another – then the differences are statistically significant.

This should be expressed differently in 2 places in the measure:

In ‘Things you need to know’:

> Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.
>
> Differences are statistically significant if the results for the 2 groups or time periods being compared are within entirely different ranges.

In Methodology:

> Observed differences are considered statistically significant when the 95% confidence intervals for 2 groups don't overlap.

An example of non-overlapping confidence intervals would be where the results for one ethnic group fell between a lower confidence limit of 72.3% and an upper confidence limit of 76.4%, and another’s were between 68.1% and 69.2%.

### Statistical tests

The design of some surveys mean tests can’t be carried out for statistical significance, yet the results are still meaningful. The following boilerplate can be adapted for these circumstances:

> To increase the reliability of the data, which is taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) combines data for each year into a 3-year average. This process continues over a series of overlapping 3-year periods.

This type of survey methodology means that some statistical tests for significant differences between ethnic groups have not been carried out. However, commentary has been supplied for those findings where differences between ethnic groups are reasonably reliable.

### Suppression and disclosure

Explain these concepts, where they are applicable.

For data suppressed or not disclosed to preserve confidentiality, adapt the following and include in ‘Things you need to know’:

> The Department for Education (DfE) has excluded, or ‘suppressed’, very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular standard).
This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality.

For data suppressed or not disclosed because of small sample size, adapt the following:

> Data for some Muslim and Sikh schools was not included in these statistics, because the small numbers of pupils make it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about their attainment.

If there’s only suppression in some dimensions in a measure, you can adapt the following:

> It is not possible to look in detail at (the characteristics of the type of households with damp problems). This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics such as (income, socio-economic group, region or age) are not large enough to give reliable estimates.’

### Survey uncertainty

Use the following plain English boilerplate in ‘Things you need to know’:

>These statistics are estimates based on the sample of people who took part in the survey, and may not reflect the whole population. You should therefore use caution when interpreting them.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="t" class="atoz-section">T</h2>

### Total household income

Total household income is a metric frequently used in housing measures. Use the following explanation of the concept in the Methodology section:

> Total household income is the combined income of all members of the household. It includes income from all sources including earnings from employment and self-employment, pensions (both state and private), benefits and tax credits, interest from savings and investments, maintenance, student grants and rent payments received.
>
> Due to the nature of the question, some respondents gave insufficient information to classify their household income or declined to answer the question.
>
> Those cases with insufficient information may include respondents who did not know the income of other household members.
>
> Income is banded as follows:
>
> - Less than £10,000
> - £10,000 to less than £20,000
> - £20,000 to less than £30,000
> - £30,000 to less than £40,000
> - £40,000 to less than £50,000
> - £50,000 or more
> - No income stated or not enough information provided’

### Trends across time series

Uncertainty around results based on small sample sizes is reduced if the results are consistent over a number of years. Use the following boilerplate:

> Where ethnic groups have consistently low or high scores over several survey years, this can somewhat offset the uncertainty around survey estimates from one year.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="u" class="atoz-section">U</h2>

### Unemployment

Use the following boilerplate in 'What the data measures' if you need to define unemployment:

> A person is counted as unemployed if all 3 of the following apply:
>
> * they are out of work
> * they are available to start work in the next 2 weeks
> * they have either been actively looking for work in the past 4 weeks or have found a job and are waiting to start it
>
> This is the International Labour Organisation’s definition of ‘unemployment’ and is often used in published UK statistics. It gives more accurate figures for unemployment than alternatives such as a count of claimants for out-of-work benefits.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="v" class="atoz-section">V</h2>

### Variance

Explain survey results which are unreliable due to variance by adapting the following boilerplate:

> Respondents answered the question ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?’ on a scale of 0 to 10. Where an average result for the ethnic group studied is based on a small range of answers (for example, life satisfaction between 6 and 8 out of 10) we can be fairly confident about that survey estimate.
>
> However, when the average result is based on a wide variation in answers (for example, life satisfaction between 4 and 9 out of 10) we can be much less certain of the reliability of the survey estimate. Where no commentary has been supplied for trends or differences apparently visible in the charts and tables, it’s because this wide variation (known as ‘variance’) makes them unreliable.

### Volatility

Use ‘variable’ instead of ‘volatile’, or avoid both terms, as in the following:

Original:

> Data on Gypsy or Irish Traveller respondents exhibit volatility due to the small sample size, and therefore should be treated with caution

Rewrite:

> For the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group, the number of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
<h2 id="w" class="atoz-section">W</h2>

### Weighting

If data hasn’t been weighted, this information should be included in ‘Things you need to know’.

Otherwise, it can be explained in Methodology.

For a national survey:

> Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.
>
> For example, a survey which contains 25% women and 75% men will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know has an even 50/50 split.
>
> Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable.
>
> Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.’

For a specifically targeted survey, use the following instead:

> Surveys seek information about a particular group of people – we call this the target population.
>
> Every target population will have a particular age and gender profile – for example, teachers are predominantly female and under 50. Some target populations will also have a regional profile – for example, they might be clustered in a particular part of the country.
>
> Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population.
>
> For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.
>
> Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions.

### White British

See ‘2 ethnic categories’ in this guide.

### Working age

‘Working age’ usually includes everyone aged 16 to 64 years.

### Worst

Avoid value judgements.

Bad example:

> Gypsy/Roma pupils did worst.

Good example:

> Gypsy/Roma pupils were least likely to meet the expected standards.

### X axis and Y axis

Check that the titles of charts and tables are descriptive enough that X and Y axis labels aren’t needed.
