title: A-Z of terminology

### BME or BAME
Avoid these terms. ONS (Office for National Statistics) prefers ‘ethnic minorities’ and we like be as specific as possible, for example, ‘ethnic minorities, excluding White ethnic minorities’.
If you’re comparing White British people to everyone else, including White ethnic minorities, you could refer to ‘other ethnic groups’.

### Disparity
Use in preference to discrimination, but consider difference, which may be better understood.

### Ethnic categories
Depending on how, when and by whom the data was gathered, among other factors, it can be divided into the 18 specific categories used in the ONS 2011 Census, or a variety of less detailed or different categories. Each measure page should offer a reasonable explanation of the different ethnic categories used.

### Gender v sex
We use both, because we follow the lead set by the department, which will depend on their data and survey type.

### Geographic coverage
Use 'England, Wales and Scotland' in preference to 'Great Britain'.
Use UK in text (no need to use 'United Kingdom (UK)' as it is sufficiently well known).

### Major and minor race groups
Avoid. Use broad and specific ethnic groups.

### Non-White
Avoid. We refer to ‘other ethnic groups’ or ‘ethnic minority groups, including/excluding White ethnic minorities’.

### NS-SEC
Avoid. Use ‘socio-economic groups’.

### Other

Several uses.

In the sentence, ‘White people were more likely to be home-owners than all other ethnic groups’, the word ‘other’ refers to everyone who isn’t White and remains lower case.
In a chart, this will be abbreviated to Other (capital). We also refer to White Other, Asian Other as subsets of these ethnic groups, uses that also take a capital, for clarity.

### Race

Contentious in user testing because of its associations with colonialism and racism. Use ethnic group or ethnicity instead.
Statistically significant findings
Not well understood. Use ‘reliable findings’ or ‘firm conclusions’ instead.


### Abbreviations and acronyms

The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full (unless it’s well known, like UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT and MP). This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials. Example: “further education (FE)” then “FE” subsequently. Where it appears in both the main text and one or more dimension summaries, treat each dimension summary as a new beginning and write the term out in full, abbreviation in brackets, then abbreviation for other mentions.

BUT, in all cases, if the term only appears once in a summary, use the full term but omit the abbreviation.

Where we need to refer to it in main points and then in dimensions, we treat each new summary, as well as the 'measure explanation' and 'things you need to know' segments, as a new starting point - use the the full term and abbr in brackets, then abbr thereafter.

### Time periods

say ‘from 2012 to 2014’ or ‘each year from 2012 to 2014’ instead; where necessary add this to data reliability section: “When observing trends in these statistics, you should not assume the existence or absence of trends outside the time period covered by this measure.”
Put age-standardisation into Methodology for preference, but if necessary, use this text in ‘Things you need to know’ (example here is from DH021):


### Age standardisation

“These statistics have been age-standardised so comparisons can be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile (an age profile shows the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group). The statistics do not tell you the actual percentage of people in each ethnic group [who experienced a CMD (or equivalent)].”

then put more granular explanation in Methodology, along the lines of:

“The resulting statistics for CMD have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of common mental disorders is related to age and the age profile can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.

Each survey involved interviewing a large stratified probability sample of the general population, covering people living in private households. The full adult age range was covered, with the youngest participants aged 16 and the oldest over 100. ”

### Confidence intervals

Where available, confidence intervals are put in the downloads section.

User research has established they are too technical to be included in Things you need to know or elsewhere in the non-technical sections of a measure.

If they appear in downloads, include a section in Methodology like this one, from Overweight children:

Confidence intervals
Confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the ‘download the data’ section.

Based on the NCMP measurements, it’s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight or obese in England in 2015/16.

The NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight or obese, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.

It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds in England were overweight or obese in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.

The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.

Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.

### Volatility due to the small sample size

Plain English alternative: ‘the numbers of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions’.
