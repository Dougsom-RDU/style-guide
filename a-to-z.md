title: A to Z of content design for ethnicity statistics
---

### Abbreviations and acronyms
If a noun has an accepted abbreviation or acronym and is used more than once in a section, use both the full term and the abbreviation/acronym on its first mention. Then use only the abbreviation/acronym on further mentions in that section. For example: “further education (FE)”, then just “FE” after that.

The main points are considered a section for these purposes, as are the list of summary points for each graph/table and all accordioned content (eg Things you need to know, What the data measures, etc).

### Age standardisation
Age standardisation should normally be referenced in the Methodology section, but can instead be referred to in ‘Things you need to know’ if analysts deem it important enough. Use the following approach for ‘Things you need to know’:  

> These statistics have been age-standardised so comparisons can be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile (an age profile shows the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group). The statistics do not tell you the actual percentage of people in each ethnic group who [insert text relevant to measure here]."

A more detailed explanation can be used if it appears in Methodology instead. Following is sample text for how this might be worded: 

> The resulting statistics for [insert reference to what’s being measured here] have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of [what’s being measured] is related to age and the age profile can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.

### BAME and BME
Avoid these terms and instead use 'ethnic minorities (other than White ethnic minorities)'.

### Confidence intervals
Where available, confidence intervals are included in the downloads section.  Do not make any reference to them in the commentary except in the Methodology section, using text along the lines of the following (taken from the health measure on harmful drinking): 

> Confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the ‘download the data’ section. 

> Based on the NCMP measurements, it’s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight or obese in England in 2015/16.

> The NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight or obese, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage. 

> It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds in England were overweight or obese in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.

> The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.

> Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.

### Confounding factors 
Rather than using this term use a short, plain English explanation of any factors that might affect the reliability of the analysis. For example: 

> Inactivity levels are related to weight gain, but so is age – as people age they generally gain more weight.

### Data vs statistics
Survey results, counts from administrative records and any raw numbers are data. When these are analysed and presented as a measurement about a population they are statistics.

Data would include, for example, a count of 43 White adult prisoners in the Northeast that were involved in prison violence. The statistic would be that 32% of White adult prisoners in the Northeast were involved in prison violence.

### Dates and date ranges 
Dates that span parts of 2 calendar years should be expressed in the format 2015/16. One exception would be when referencing a title that expresses dates differently – for example, ‘The English Housing Survey 2013-14’ – leave it as the author(s) of the report write it. 

Don’t write ‘across the years presented’ or ‘in each of the years presented’. Instead use the format 'from 2012 to 2014' or 'each year from 2012 to 2014'.

For measures where there may be confusion between academic and financial years, add a line in the ‘What the data measures’ section explaining that both are used.

Where multiple years of data have been combined, this should be expressed under 'Time period covered' in the format: "2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)"

### Double, treble/triple, quadruple
While it’s acceptable to use ‘double’ or ‘twice’ in commentary, avoid using the terms triple/treble or thrice, or quadruple. Instead write ‘3 times as many’, or ‘3 times the number’, etc. 

### Ethnic minorities
This is an acceptable alternative to ‘people from ethnic minority groups’, but be sure to indicate whether it also includes White ethnic minorities such as people from a Gypsy or Irish Traveller background.

### Ethnicity breakdowns
Most measures use 1 of 4 ethnicity breakdowns, which should be included in the section called ‘The ethnic categories used in this data’. Use the following wording.

### Ethnicity breakdown: 16+1
The 16 categories used in this data are those listed in the 2001 census. The categories are broadly the same as those used in the 2011 census, with the following exceptions:


* the 2001 census categorised Chinese people within 'Other ethnic group'.
* the 2001 census did not list Gypsy and Irish Travellers or Arab people. 

The 2001 categories are therefore as follows:

White:

* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British
* Irish
* Any Other White background

Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups:

* White and Black Caribbean
* White and Black African
* White and Asian
* Any Other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background

Asian/Asian British:

* Indian
* Pakistani
* Bangladeshi
* Any Other Asian background

Black/African/Caribbean/Black British:

* African
* Caribbean
* Any Other Black/ African/ Caribbean background

Other ethnic group:

* Chinese
* Any Other ethnic group
	
### Ethnicity breakdown: 18+1
This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 census.

White:

* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British
* Irish
* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller 
* Any Other White background

Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups:

* White and Black Caribbean
* White and Black African
* White and Asian
* Any Other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background

Asian/Asian British:

* Indian
* Pakistani
* Bangladeshi
* Chinese
* Any Other Asian background

Black/African/Caribbean/Black British:

* African
* Caribbean
* Any Other Black/African/Caribbean background

Other ethnic group:

* Arab
* Any Other ethnic group

### Ethnicity breakdown: 5+1
For this data, the number of people surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories. Therefore, the data is broken down into the following 5 broad groups: 

* White 
* Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups 
* Asian/Asian British
* Black/African/Caribbean/Black British 
* Other ethnic group

### Ethnicity breakdown: binary (two types)
The following binary categories have been used: 

* White British and Other – White British people compared with all other groups (including White ethnic minorities and all other ethnic minorities)
* White and Other – White ethnic groups (including White British and White ethnic minorities) compared with all other ethnic minorities

### Figures in commentary
In main points and summary points, refer to rates, percentages or commonly used fractions. Do not list the raw number, which overloads the point with numbers, as shown in this example:  

> in 2015/16, there were 540,689 14 to 16-year-olds at maintained schools in England –
9.6% were Asian (51,218 pupils)' 

If analysts specify that it’s important to include the denominator for context, put this in the first, separate bullet. If this results in too many bullets, include the information in the section on ‘Things you need to know’.

### Fractions
Acceptable fractions include half, three-quarters, one-third, one-fifth and one tenth. Always write them out (don’t use numbers such as ½, ¾ etc). See ONS style guide for further guidance.  

### Gender vs sex
Use the same term used in the source, whether that’s a question in a survey or a field in an administrative form.  

### Geographic coverage
Do not use ‘Great Britain’. Use ‘England, Wales and Scotland’ instead. Write ‘UK’ rather than ‘United Kingdom’. 

Graph and/or table shows non-significant differences
Sometimes a graph and/or table will show differences between ethnic groups that aren’t statistically significant. It’s important to address this in commentary, usually in a bulleted point such as this example:

> although the graph shows a difference in home ownership for under 35s, sample sizes for this group are small, so any generalisations based on this result are very unreliable

### Great Britain
See 'Geographic coverage'

### Income 
Total household income is a metric frequently used in housing measures. Use the following explanation of the concept in the Methodology section: 

Total household income is the combined income of all members of the household. It includes income from all sources including earnings from employment and self-employment, pensions (both state and private), benefits and tax credits, interest from savings and investments, maintenance, student grants and rent payments received. 

Due to the nature of the question, some respondents gave insufficient information to classify their household income or declined to answer the question. 

Those cases with insufficient information may include respondents who did not know the income of other household members. 

Income is banded as follows:

- Less than £10,000
- £10,000 to less than £20,000
- £20,000 to less than £30,000
- £30,000 to less than £40,000
- £40,000 to less than £50,000
- £50,000 or more
- No income stated or not enough information provided

### Levels
If the department’s source material refers to levels then use the term. For example, ‘levels of satisfaction’ are described in various health measures. But do not introduce as a way to describe data, such as replacing ‘percentage of homeowners’ with ‘levels of home ownership’. 

### Major race groups
Don’t describe ethnicity in this way – use 'broad ethnic groups' instead.

### Minor race groups
Don’t describe ethnicity in this way – use ‘specific ethnic groups’ instead. 

### Missing data
Use the following symbols in charts and tables to identify types of missing data:

`!` – data withheld for confidentiality
`?` – data not shown because small sample size makes it unreliable
`-` – data not collected
`N/A` – data not applicable (eg no meaningful numerator)

### Non-White 
Don’t use this term. Instead write ‘ethnic minority groups (except White ethnic minorities)’. See also ‘Writing about ethnicity’.

### NS-SEC
this stands for ‘National Statistics Socio-economic Classification’, but use 'socio-economic groups' rather than 'NS-SEC' in commentary text and chart titles. The following text can be included in the Methodology section:

The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) categorises members of the adult public in the UK according to their occupational status. 

The NS-SEC categories are: 

- Managerial and professional occupations 
- Intermediate occupations (clerical, sales, service) 
- Routine and manual occupations 
- Never worked and long-term unemployed 
- Full-time students 
- Not classified

### Only 
Avoid using ‘only’ as a value judgment when describing findings. For example, don’t say ‘Asian pupils only scored X’.  

### Other
When describing ethnicity, write ‘the Other ethnic group’ – using 'the' not 'an', with a capital ‘O’ and no quotes. 

### Percentage
Use the symbol (%) in text, not the word ‘percent’. When describing an increase or decrease, refer to ‘an increase of 8 percentage points’ rather than ‘an increase of 8%’. The latter can be ambiguous. 

### Proportion vs percentage
A percentage of something is expressed in a number out of 100, while a proportion is out of 1. Don't confuse the 2: only use % when the measurement is out of 100. Proportion is a number in relation to the whole.  Be consistent in usage within a sentence - that is, don’t combine proportion and percentage in one point. 

### Race
Don’t use the term except in the term ‘mixed race’. Instead use the term ethnicity.

### Rate 
Rate is the same as ratio. It means a certain number out of another, larger amount (for example, out of 1,000 of the population). 

### Regions
In titles for different charts and tables, use ‘by area’ rather than ‘by region’. This is because testing has shown that people frequently misread the latter as ‘by religion’ and didn’t catch their own mistake.

It’s fine to use ‘region’ in commentary text, however. Use initial capitals when referring to official regions such as the North West, East of England, and so on. 

### Reliability / sample size

It will often be necessary to include a caveat in the ‘Things you need to know’ about the reliability of data where sample sizes for some ethnic groups are small. Use the following phrasing: 

> Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.

Similarly, in points you may have to address the unreliability of data around particular ethnic groups with very small sample sizes, for example: 

> for the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group, the numbers of people surveyed was too small to draw firm conclusions

### Rounding caveat

‘We round numbers in our commentary and for this reason some figures may not add up, and numbers quoted in commentary may not exactly match numbers in charts and tables.’

### Statistical significance
For measures based on survey data, it’s often necessary to address statistical significance. Write a plain English explanation in the ‘Things you need to know’ section, using the following format: 

The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about the total population.
 
For example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.
 
The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.
 
Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.

Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.

### Suppression
Although there is a separate field in measures for suppression, an analyst may feel it’s particularly important for some measures to highlight this in the ‘Things you need to know’ section. In such cases, use the following format of text: 

> [the department] has ‘suppressed’ very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular level). ‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data, because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.
 
> Where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded. This type of exclusion, also called ‘suppression’ of data, is consistent with [the department's] statistical policy statement on confidentiality.

### Trends across time series
Uncertainty around results based on small sample sizes can be offset to a degree if the results are consistently similar across a number of years. If this is the case, explain this using the following phrasing: 

Where ethnic groups have consistently low or high scores over several survey years, this can somewhat offset the uncertainty around survey estimates from one year.

### Volatile
Rather than this term use the more plain English ‘variable’.

### Weighting
Mention weighting only in Methodology, unless the results have not been weighted (in which state this in ‘Things you need to know’).

Following are 2 examples of how to explain weighting:

Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.

For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female. 

Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable. 

Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population. 

All surveys carry the risk of biased results if some types of people are less likely to respond than others. To compensate for this the GP Patient Survey includes a weight to account for this non-response bias. This adjusts the data to account for potential differences between the demographic profile of all eligible patients in a practice and the patients who actually complete the questionnaire. The non-response weighting scheme has been developed by Ipsos MORI, incorporating elements such as age and gender as well as factors from the area where the respondent lives such as level of deprivation, ethnicity profile, ACORN classification and so on, which have been shown to impact on non-response bias within the GP Patient Survey

If needed, a plain English version of weighting for a specific target population could look like this:

Surveys seek information about a particular group of people – we call this the target population.  
 
Every target population will have a particular age and gender profile – for example, teachers are predominantly female and under 50. Some target populations will also have a regional profile – for example, they might be clustered in a particular part of the country. 

Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population.
 
For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.
 
Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions. 

### Worst / worse
Don’t use these terms when describing findings. For example, don’t say 'Gypsy/Roma pupils did worst'. Instead write 'Gypsy/Roma pupils were least likely to meet the expected standards'.

### X axis and Y axis
Labels for these shouldn’t be necessary if the charts and tables have good titles.
