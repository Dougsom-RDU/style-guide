title: Measure page guidance
---

A measure page represents a data set which has been analysed according to 1 or more ‘dimensions’ (sometimes called ‘analyses’).

For example, the [Unemployment measure page](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/unemployment/latest) analyses unemployment by ethnicity; by ethnicity over time; by ethnicity and region; by ethnicity and gender; and by ethnicity and age.

Each of these dimensions can be illustrated with a chart and/or table, and a summary.

The commentary on the measure page is organised into different sections, so as to meet the needs of a wide variety of users.

Use these guidelines to complete or update your commentary for a measure page.

## Basic information

### Title

A plain English version of what the data measures. Use terms people are likely to search for, and front-load the most important content.

Bad example:

> Households by ethnic group of head and total weekly household income, three-year averages, United Kingdom

Good example:

> Household income

### Time period

The time period the data covers. See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for date formulations.

### Area covered

The geographical area the data covers. See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for style guidance on regions.

### Lowest level of geography

Select one of the following:

* United Kingdom
* Country (for example, England, Wales, England and Wales, Scotland)
* Region (for example, South West, London, North West, Wales)
* Local authority upper (for example, county council and unitary authority)
* Local authority lower (for example, district council and unitary authority)
* Police force area
* Clinical commissioning group

If other, please contact the team to arrange for another option to be added.

## Primary source

### Title

The name of the data source (for example, Annual Population Survey). This should match the title of the page given as the data source URL.

### Publishing department

The department responsible for analysing and/or publishing the data in the first instance (for example, Department for Education).

### Source URL

Provide a link to the data source.

### Frequency of release

How often is this data collected and published?

* Monthly
* Quarterly
* 3 times per year
* Twice a year
* Yearly
* Every 2 years
* Every 3 years
* Every 4 years
* Every 5 years

### Statistic type

Select one of the following:

* National Statistics
* Official statistics
* Experimental statistics

If there is a need to specify some other option, please contact the team to discuss.

### Suppression rules

Has data been excluded from the analysis because small sample sizes make it unreliable, or for any other reason? Please specify.

If no data has been excluded, leave this section blank.

### Disclosure control

Has data been excluded from the analysis to protect confidentiality? Please specify.

If no data has been excluded, leave this section blank.

### Contact – Person primarily responsible for source

Give details for the person responsible for the data source. This information is not visible to users.

## Commentary

### Main points

This section is intended for high-level findings about the data, serving as an instant takeaway for users.

Its content should therefore:

* supply context where appropriate (for example, ‘14.3 million (63%) of the estimated 22.6 million households in England in 2015/16 were in home ownership’)
* summarise the most important findings on the page (across all the dimensions analysed)
* help users unfamiliar with charts and tables understand what they’re looking at
* where possible, work as stand-alone statements (as they may be quoted out of context)
* alert users to serious caveats about the quality of the data
* be written in between 6 and 8 bullet points

### Things you need to know

Use this section to explain factors that might lead users to misinterpret or misunderstand the data, for example:

* sample sizes, suppression, missing data
* changes in methodology over time
* limitations in the quality or reliability of the data

Even quite complex statistical concepts can and should be translated into plain English for users.

Sometimes, it’s helpful to offer a simplified version of a statistical caveat or test, and refer specialist users to ‘Methodology’ or ‘Download the data’ for more detailed and/or technical information.

See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for boilerplated plain English explanations for specialist concepts.

Suggested maximum word count: 250

### What the data measures

Use this section to add context and background to the data. For example:

* what this data tells users (for example, ‘This data measures how likely people in different ethnic groups are to own their own homes’)
* the source of the data (for example, ‘The figures are drawn from the 2014/15 and 2015/16 English Housing Survey (EHS)’)
* technical aspects that need further explanation (for example, ‘Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds; in these circumstances, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person to define the ethnic background of the household’)
* plain English definitions of terms used in the measure (for example, ‘Young people’ means people aged 10 to 17 years’)
* what’s included where ‘other’ is used to categorise certain parts of the data (for example, ‘Types of crime under ‘Other offences’ include:...’

Again, even quite complex statistical concepts can and should be translated into plain English for users.

Suggested maximum word count: 500

### Why these ethnic categories were chosen

[UK government organisations use a variety of different lists of ethnicities](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnicity-in-the-uk). These lists also change over time to reflect the nation’s changing population.

Although the Office of National Statistics (ONS) set out a standardised list of ethnicities in the 2011 Census, in practice there is no single standard across the public sector.

Use this section to explain, in plain English, the ethnic categorisation used in this measure page and why it differs from ONS’s standardised list.

See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for the most common ethnic categorisations.

Suggested maximum word count: 100


## Methodology and type of data

### Type of data

Select either or both of:

* Survey (including census)
* Administrative

### Purpose of data source

Why is government (or another body) collecting this data?

Example from [Reading attainments for children aged 7 to 11](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest):

> The primary purpose is to measure schools and pupils progress and performance from key stage 1 to key stage 2 to monitor and improve standards and inform parental choice when applying to local schools.

### Methodology

The UK Statistics Authority’s Code of Practice is clear that transparency is important to maintain public trust in statistics:

> Transparent judgements about statistical definitions and methods, together with judgements about strengths and limitations, are essential in supporting confidence in the quality of the statistics. [Five whys: the Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/five-whys-the-code-of-practice/)

Use ‘Things you need to know’ to provide the non-specialist user with honest and clearly expressed caveats about the limitations of the data.

Use ‘Methodology’ to give statisticians, specialists and experts in the field a detailed methodological description.

The language in this section may need to be more specialist and technical than the commentary elsewhere. However it should be as accessible as possible to the interested non-specialist.

Methodology may include:

* size of survey
* collection methods
* limitations to the data
* age standardisation
* weighting
* confidence intervals

Content on weighting and confidence intervals should be given separate subheads and be listed last in the methodology section.

### Rounding

Specify the rounding rules used in commentary and data.

### Related publications

Use this section to list further reading or related data sets.

Example from [Reading attainments for children aged 7 to 11](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest):

> [Schools, pupils and their characteristics: January 2016](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2016)

### Quality Methodology Information link

Provide a link to the data’s quality methodology report.

### Further technical information

Please supply any other information you think is relevant.

Example from [Illicit drug use among adults](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/physical-and-mental-health/illicit-drug-use-among-adults/latest):

> [Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014](http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748)

## Downloads
Please specify what the download file contains, for example:

This file contains the following: ethnicity, year, geography, gender, age group, NS-SEC (socio-economic group), income, region, value, denominator, numerator, confidence intervals.

See the [data style guide](/) for more information.

## Dimensions

### Title

Create a plain English version of the data dimension. Remember that ‘by ethnicity’ comes first, followed by a second or third cut of the data.

Bad example:

> 16 to 64 year olds not in full-time education who are employed, by highest qualification and ethnicity

Good example:

> Employment, by qualification level and ethnicity

Add another cut:

> Employment, by qualification level, ethnicity and gender

### Time period

The time period this dimension of the data covers.

### Summaries

Use the summary to comment in detail on the findings presented in this dimension.

Content should:

* avoid repetition of the Main points by providing detail specific to this dimension
* draw out the important and reliable findings and trends over time
* alert users to serious caveats about the quality of the data
* where possible, work as stand-alone statements (as they may be quoted out of context)
* avoid simply repeating the numbers in the tables and charts
* avoid overloading users with information they can’t absorb
* account for differences visible in the charts which aren’t meaningful
* be written in between 6 and 8 bullet points

The example below, taken from [Overweight adults](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/preventing-illness/overweight-adults/latest) illustrates the difference between a measure’s main points and summary.

Main points:

> the percentage of White adults and Black adults who were overweight in the period 2013 to 2015 was higher than the average for all adults in England

Summary:

> in the period 2013 to 2015, the percentage of adults who were overweight was 66% for White people and 67% for Black people, both higher than the average for all adults in England
