title: Writing about ethnicity (Draft)
---

In general, content for the Ethnicity facts and figures website and publications follows the ethnicity guidelines in [ONS style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#race-and-ethnicity).  

## Language

### Ethnicity and race

We refer to ethnicity and not race. This is because:

* surveys and questionnaires usually ask respondents for their ethnicity not their race
* using consistent terms makes it easier for people to understand our data


### Ethnic minorities, BAME and BME

We use ‘ethnic minorities’ to refer to all ethnic groups except the White British group. ‘Ethnic minorities’ includes White minorities, such as Irish Travellers.  

For comparisons with the White group (including White minorities), we use ‘all other ethnic groups combined’ or ‘ethnic minorities (excluding White minorities)’. We also occasionally refer to ‘White’ and ‘Other than White’, for example in tables and charts where space is limited.

We do not use ‘Non-White’ because defining groups in relation to the White majority was not well received in user testing.

We do not use Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) or Black and minority ethnic (BME) because:

* the UK’s ethnic minorities include White minorities
* they highlight some groups and not others – for example, Black and Asian people are included but not people of a Mixed ethnicity
* user research, the acronyms BAME and BME were not well understood by our audience

### Broad and specific ethnic groups

We avoid using ‘broad’ and ‘specific’ when referring to individual ethnic groups. For example, the ‘broad’ Asian group or the ‘specific’ Pakistani group. This is because these terms aren’t widely used outside of data collection.
 
If we need to, we refer to ethnic groups ‘as a whole’. For example, ‘the Black ethnic group as a whole’ rather than ‘the broad Black ethnic group’.

### Phrasing

In user testing, ‘People from a Black Caribbean background’, ‘the Black ethnic group’ and ‘Black people’ were all acceptable phrases. ‘Blacks’ was not.

Similarly ‘People from a White British background’, ‘the White ethnic group’ and ‘White people’ are all acceptable. 

However, don’t say 'Mixed people' or 'Mixed race people'. Say 'people with Mixed ethnicity', ‘people from the Mixed ethnic group’ or ‘people from a Mixed ethnic background’. 

### Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ethnic groups

It is common to differentiate between Gypsy, Roma and Irish Traveller communities in the UK. 

‘Gypsy or Irish Traveller’ is one of the [18 standardised ethnic groups](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnic-groups). However data is sometimes collected for a Gypsy/Roma group or White Gypsy/Traveller group, for example.

We don’t use slashes (/) in commentary as this can imply these terms are the same. Instead we refer to:

* ‘the Gypsy and Roma ethnic group’ or ‘Gypsy and Roma people’
* ‘the Gypsy and Traveller ethnic group’  or ‘Gypsy and  Traveller people’

For example:

* 29% of White Gypsy and Roma pupils met the expected standard in reading compared with 31% of White Irish Traveller pupils
* 75.2% of people from the Gypsy and Traveller ethnic group were satisfied with GP out-of-hours services 

## Ordering and style

### Capitalisation
 
We capitalise all ethnic groups. For example, Asian, Black, Mixed, White, Gypsy, Irish Traveller, and Other.
 
This is because:
 
* ethnic groups such as Asian and Indian must take a capital so this maintains a consistent approach for all groups
* it makes our content easier to read if we’re comparing ‘the Other ethnic group’ with other ethnic groups

For this reason in commentary we write, for example, ‘people from the Asian Other ethnic group’. This is despite the fact the category is usually ‘Any other Asian background’. 

### Order of ethnic categories

Generally, ONS orders categories in order of size. However, in research users were sometimes offended when White was placed first in commentary, charts and tables. They were also confused by the way ethnic categories found in different contexts were presented in varying orders.

Ethnic groups are therefore ordered alphabetically in charts and tables, with ‘Other’, and occasionally ‘Unknown’, as a final category.

## Ethnicities and nationalities

These ethnic groups are also nationalities: 

* Bangladeshi
* Chinese
* Indian
* Pakistani

We avoid ambiguity when referring to them by writing:

* ‘people from the Indian ethnic group’, not 'Indian people'
* ‘pupils from the Chinese ethnic group’, not ‘Chinese pupils’

## Help us stay up to date

Language usage and acceptability change over time. We want to make sure our content reflects those changes. Contact us at [ethnicity@cabinetoffice.gov.uk](mailto:ethnicity@cabinetoffice.gov.uk) with your thoughts and research.
