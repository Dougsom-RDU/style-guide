title: Writing about ethnicity
---

We follow the [ONS style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#race-and-ethnicity) when writing about ethnicity.   

There are some exceptions. Listed here are the things not covered by the ONS style guide, but we use. We based these on user research done for the project.
