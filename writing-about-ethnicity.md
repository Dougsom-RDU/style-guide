title: Writing about ethnicity
---

We follow the [ONS style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#race-and-ethnicity) when writing about ethnicity.   

There are some exceptions. Listed here are the things not covered by the ONS style guide, but we use. We based these on user research done for the project.

## BAME/BME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic/Black and minority ethnic)
Don’t use these terms, use ‘ethnic minorities’ instead. This is because:

the UK’s ethnic minorities include White ethnic minorities
the terms BAME and BME highlight particular groups while others are omitted – for example, they include Black and Asian people but not people of a Mixed ethnicity
research shows that the majority of our users don’t understand the acronyms

See also ethnic minorities.

## Broad and specific ethnic groups

Avoid using ‘broad’ and ‘specific’ when referring to an individual ethnic group.

If it’s a broad group, say ‘the Black ethnic group as a whole’ rather than ‘the broad Black ethnic group’.

## Capitalisation

Ethnic categories, including Asian, Black, Mixed, White and Other, all take a capital. 

When referring  to ‘all other ethnic groups’ use a lowercase ‘o’.

## Ethnic minorities

You can use ‘ethnic minorities’ to describe all the ethnic groups in a dataset, excluding White British. 

Do not use it to collectively refer to Black, Asian and Mixed groups. This is because ethnic minorities include White minorities, such as White Irish. 

See also Non-White.

## Ethnicities and nationalities

These ethnic groups are also nationalities: 

Bangladeshi
Chinese
Indian
Pakistani

Avoid ambiguity when referring to them.

Write:

* ‘people from the Indian ethnic group’, not 'Indian people'
* ‘pupils from the Chinese ethnic group’, not ‘Chinese pupils’

It’s fine to say ‘Black people’ and ‘White people’.

## Ethnicity versus race

Use the word ‘ethnicity’ on the website instead of race because:

data collection asks respondents for their ethnicity not their race
using consistent terminology helps users understand the content

## Mixed ethnicity

Say 'people with Mixed ethnicity', ‘people from the Mixed ethnic group’ or ‘people from a Mixed ethnic background’. Don't say 'Mixed people' or 'Mixed race people'.

## Non-White

Don’t say ‘non-White’. Use ‘ethnic minorities excluding White minorities’. For tables and charts, you can refer to ‘White’ and ‘Other than White’.

## Order of ethnic categories

Generally, ONS orders categories in order of size. However, in research labs users were sometimes offended when White was placed first in commentary, charts and tables. They were also confused by the way ethnic categories found in different contexts were presented in varying orders.

Ethnic groups are therefore ordered alphabetically in charts and tables, with ‘Other’, and occasionally ‘Unknown’, as a final category.

## ‘Other’ ethnic groups

‘Other’ can refer to the following ethnic groups.
A broad ethnic group

For example, Asian, Black, Mixed, White, Other.

In commentary, write ‘people from the Other ethnic group’.

## A specific ethnic group

For example, ‘Any other Asian background’, ‘Any other Black background’.

In commentary, write ‘people from the Asian Other ethnic group’ and ‘people from the Black Other ethnic group’.

## All other ethnic groups except White or White British

Where you're comparing 2 ethnic groups – for example, White and Other.

In commentary, you can write:

* ‘people from the Other ethnic group’
* ‘people from all other ethnic groups combined’ (but this should come after the White group in a sentence)
* ‘people from ethnic minorities’ (but only if you’re comparing White British and Other)

## Phrasing

In user testing, ‘People from a Black Caribbean background’, ‘the Black ethnic group’ and ‘Black people’ were all acceptable phrases. ‘Blacks’ was not.
