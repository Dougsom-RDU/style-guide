title: Writing for Ethnicity facts and figures
---

Ethnicity facts and figures (EFF) is based on a wide range of government data. Much of that data has been interpreted using complex statistical methods and is accompanied by extensive contextual information.

To be useful to a wide array of audiences, the findings based on this data must be presented in a way that is easy for all audiences to understand, and in a consistent style and format.

These guidelines give a broad overview of the principles used in designing content for the website, as well as high-level guidance on things to consider when writing about ethnicity and about statistics in general.

It is to be used alongside the section on [content design patterns (A to Z)](a-to-z), which provides easily searchable, alphabetised guidance on more specific content issues.

## Writing style and tone of voice

This website uses measures to present findings around specific outcomes or government services. Measures are separate pages that summarise the findings for different ethnic groups with graphs and tables as well as written commentary. 
 
It’s important that the written commentary communicates the findings in a way that will be read and understood by all the website’s audiences. To do this it must:

- be based on the needs of readers first and foremost

- avoid specialist jargon, using plain English whenever possible

- be as succinct as possible

- present any complex explanations in as simple a way as possible

- be consistent in its phrasing and presentation

- use the appropriate tone of voice

These principles of writing are drawn from GOV.UK guidance. This includes the GOV.UK style guide, which is evidence-based, user-tested guidance for content designers across the UK government.

Where the GOV.UK style guide doesn’t provide detailed guidance on writing about statistics or ethnicity, the reference to use is the Office for National Statistics style guide.

### Simpler, clearer, faster

Ethnicity facts and figures is hosted as a service on the GOV.UK platform. There is comprehensive guidance on [writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) there, but following is an example of some of these principles being applied in the context of EFF.

Statistical significance is an important concept in statistics, but one that many people are unfamiliar with. The following description gives some level of explanation to readers who aren’t familiar with statistics, but will likely leave many still scratching their heads: 

> The EHS is a sample survey so it is possible that some of the disparities observed have occurred purely by chance.   We use robust statistical methods to carry out the EHS.  As a result, we can identify statistically significant differences, that is, variations which have not occurred purely by chance.  Unless specified otherwise, all the differences reported in the main points below are statistically significant.

Explaining concepts succinctly and in plain English instead of jargon not only opens up the commentary to a much wider audience but also is more likely to keep the audience on the page.

> The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about the total population.

> For example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.
The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.

> Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.

Statistical significance is one of many specialist concepts that has been unpacked for a more generalist audience. See the A to Z guidance for more examples of user-friendly versions.

### Tone of voice 

Commentary should be written in a tone of voice that is informative, helpful, and objective – but not clinical. It should be reassuring but not overtly friendly or chatty.

It's important to avoid using terms that imply value judgment, such as 'only', 'best' and 'worst'. For example you should avoid using phrasing such as: 

> across all ethnic groups, girls did best at achieving A* to C in English and Maths GCSE, while boys did worst – 67% of girls did so, compared to only 59% of boys

Instead this main point should be expressed as: 

> across all ethnic groups, girls were more likely to achieve A* to C in English and Maths GCSE than boys – 67% of girls did so, compared to 59% of boys

## Writing about ethnicity

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) style guide includes [guidance on writing about race and ethnicity](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#race-and-ethnicity). The Ethnicity facts and figures (EFF) website follows their guidance on this matter, with a few exceptions and additions.

As advised by ONS, the acronyms BME and BAME are to be avoided, with 'ethnic minority' or 'ethnic minorities' used instead. However, EFF does not use the grouping 'Ethnic Minority (GB)'. 

Datasets used for EFF are broken down by ethnic group, but the breakdowns differ from measure to measure. See ‘Ethnicity breakdowns’ in the A to Z for a full list of these.

For measures in which the binary ethnic categories White and Other are used, referring to the Other category can be awkward if it appears in text isolated from the White category. This is particularly the case where Other is referred to first. Using ‘ethnic minorities’ can be clearer than ‘Other’ in these cases (since at 87% of the population, White people are in the ethnic majority). 

However, remember that Gypsy and Irish Traveller, for example, are White ethnic minorities. If the binary is White British and Other ethnic groups, then ‘ethnic minorities’ can be used. But if the binary is simply White compared to Other ethnic groups, use ‘ethnic minorities (other than White ethnic minorities)’ instead. Content designers should use their judgment as to whether this phrase or ‘Other ethnic groups’ is clearer. Consistency of approach is important.

Write about ‘ethnic groups’ rather than ‘ethnicities’ – although graph and table titles should include ‘by ethnicity’. It’s fine to occasionally refer to people from a particular ‘ethnic background’, to vary the phrasing in commentary.

It’s acceptable to refer to Black people, White people, and Asian people – but not Blacks, Whites, or Asians. For more specific ethnic categories, say ‘people from the Black Caribbean ethnic group’, for example, rather than ‘people of Black Caribean ethnicity’ or ‘Black Caribbean people’.

Similarly, use ‘people from the Gypsy and Irish Traveller ethnic group’ but not ‘Gypsies and Irish Travellers’.

## Writing about statistics

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has comprehensive guidance on [writing about statistics](https://style.ons.gov.uk/), which Ethnicity facts and figures refers to when GOV.UK guidance doesn't offer specific enough advice. 

It’s important to be careful with how you phrase statements that interpret statistical findings. Subtle changes in wording can drastically change meaning or create ambiguity where clarity is essential. 

For example writing ‘White pupils had the highest fixed rate period exclusion rate in Middlesbrough (31.39%)’ can be read 2 different ways: 

-  in Middlesbrough White pupils a higher rate of exclusion than pupils of other ethnicities

- for White pupils in the UK, the highest rates of exclusion were found in Middlesbrough 

To indicate the latter say instead that ‘the highest fixed period exclusion rate for White pupils was in Middlesbrough (31.39%)’

Along similar lines, consider the point that ‘the percentage of adults who were overweight was highest for Black people in the period 2013 to 2015’. This can also be read 2 different ways:

- of all the time periods for which there are data, 2013 to 2015 was the one in which Black adults were most likely to be overweight

- looking at the time period 2013 to 2015, Black people were more likely to be overweight than other ethnic groups

To indicate the latter say instead that ‘in the period 2013 to 2015, the percentage of adults who were overweight was highest for Black people’.

Other points to remember:

- be careful when comparing percentages between groups: ‘a higher percentage of White adults ate 5-a-day when compared with other ethnic groups’ is accurate, but ‘more White adults ate 5-a-day’ is not 

- don’t overload summary points with too many figures and quantities (for example: “in England, over half (52.3%) of adults (28 million people) ate 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day” – drop the ‘(28 million people) and this is fine)

- say ‘higher than the average for all adults in England’ not ‘higher than the England average’

- where a table shows differences between ethnic groups that aren’t statistically significant or otherwise reliable, state so in a bullet point

### Complex statistical concepts

More complex statistical concepts should be explained in the Methodology section of the measure, using approved text in the A to Z as a model that can, if necessary, be adapted. Concepts covered include confidence intervals, rounding, statistical significance and more.
