title: Writing for Ethnicity facts and figures
---

Ethnicity facts and figures (EFF) is based on a wide range of government data, much of which has been interpreted using complex statistical methods and accompanied by specific contextual information. 

To be useful to a wide array of audiences, the findings based on this data must be presented in a way that is easy for all audiences to understand, and in a style and structure that is consistent and as uniform as possible.

These guidelines give a broad overview of the principles used in designing content for the website, as well as high-level guidance on things to consider when writing about ethnicity and about statistics in general. 

It is to be used alongside the section on [content design patterns (A to Z)](a-to-z), which provides easily searchable, alphabetised guidance on more specific content issues.

## Writing style and tone of voice

This website uses measures to present findings around specific outcomes or government services. Measures are separate pages that summarise the findings for different ethnic groups with graphs and tables as well as written commentary. It's important that the commentary communicates the findings in a way that will be read and understood by all the website's audiences. To do this it must: 

- be based on the needs of the reader first and foremost
- avoid specialist jargon, using plain English whenever possible
- be as succinct as possible
- present any complex explanations in as simple a way as possible
- be consistent in its phrasing and presentation
- use the appropriate tone of voice

These principles of writing are drawn largely from GOV.UK guidance. This includes the GOV.UK style guide, the evidence-based, user tested guidance for writers across the UK government.

Where the GOV.UK style guide doesn't provide detailed guidance on writing about statistics or ethnicity, the reference to use is the Office for National Statistics style guide.

### Simpler, clearer, faster

Ethnicity facts and figures is hosted as a service on the GOV.UK platform. There is comprehensive guidance on [writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) there, but following are a few examples of these principles being applied in the context of ethnicity and statistics.

*** example, perhaps of statistical significance, before (dept) and after (rdu), demonstrating frontloading, breaking up with subheads, avoiding flurry of links, plain English, succinct etc ***

### Tone of voice 

Commentary should be written in a tone of voice that is informative, helpful, and objective – but not clinical. It should be reassuring but not overtly friendly or chatty.

It's important to avoid using terms that imply value judgment, such as 'only', 'best' and 'worst'. For example you should avoid using phrasing such as: 

> across all ethnic groups, girls did best at achieving A* to C in English and Maths GCSE, while boys did worst – 67% of girls did so, compared to only 59% of boys

Instead this main point should be expressed as: 

> across all ethnic groups, girls were more likely to achieve A* to C in English and Maths GCSE than boys – 67% of girls did so, compared to 59% of boys

## Writing about ethnicity

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) style guide includes [guidance on writing about race and ethnicity](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/house-style/language-and-spelling/#race-and-ethnicity). The Ethnicity facts and figures (EFF) website follows their guidance on this matter, with a few exceptions and additions.

As advised by ONS, the acronyms BME and BAME are to be avoided, with 'ethnic minority' or 'ethnic minorities' used instead. However, EFF does not use the grouping 'Ethnic Minority (GB)'. 

Where the binary ethnic categories White and Other are used, ‘ethnic minorities’ is a tempting alternative to ‘Other’ in commentary text (since at 87% of the population, White people are in the ethnic majority). Referring to ‘people in the Other ethnic group’ isn’t as clear as saying ‘ethnic minorities’. However, remember that Gypsy and Irish Traveller, for example, are White ethnic minorities. For this reason, it would be more accurate to use ‘ethnic minorities (other than White ethnic minorities)’ instead. Content designers should use their judgment as to whether this phrase or ‘Other’ is clearer. Consistency of approach is important.

Write about 'ethnic groups' rather than 'ethnicities' – although graph and table titles should include 'by ethnicity'. It's fine to occasionally refer to people from a particular 'ethnic background', to vary the phrasing in commentary.

It's acceptable to refer to Black people, White people, and Asian people – but not Blacks, Whites, or Asians. For more specific ethnic categories, say 'people from the Black Caribbean ethnic group', for example, rather than 'people of Black Caribean ethnicity' or 'Black Caribbean people'.

Similarly, use 'people from the Gypsy and Irish Traveller ethnic group' but not 'Gypsies and Irish Travellers'.

## Writing about statistics

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has comprehensive guidance on [writing about statistics](https://style.ons.gov.uk/), which Ethnicity facts and figures refers to when GOV.UK guidance doesn't offer specific enough advice. 

It's important to be careful with how you phrase statements that interpret statistical findings. Subtle changes in wording can drastically change meaning or create ambiguity where clarity is essential. For example:
