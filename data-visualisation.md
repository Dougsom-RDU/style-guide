In order to make the data in our service easier and faster to understand, we have used a number of different graph and table styles.

Generally weâ€™ve stuck to the most common and widely-understood formats, as more complex data visualisations are often unfamiliar to users and take longer to understand.

## [Bar charts](bar-charts)

We use these to show a breakdown of a measure by ethnicity.

## [Line charts](line-charts)

These are used for showing how the data in a measure has changed over time.

## [Tables](tables)

We display tables alongside all charts as an alternative display of the data, as well as on their own whenever the data is too complex to show in a chart.
