## Users and user needs  

Users of the Ethnicity Facts and Figures range from members of the public with a personal interest in ethnicity data to academics or data experts who work with data and perform complex data analysis. From discovery to beta we involved a broad range of users in our user research, and found that different users have different ‘jobs to be done’ and therefore different needs when it comes to ethnicity data. Based on this research we identified three different personas that we have iterated upon throughout the process; these helped us to prioritise and make decisions based on user needs. The three personas are; public with a personal interest, storytellers and changemakers. 

### Public with a personal interest

These users want to improve their life and lives of those they care about and stay on top of data on ethnicity that relate to them and their situation. For example, we have seen that parents with a child in school are interested in data on performance of the children from different ethnic backgrounds. Users from this group need data presented in a simple, clear and neutral format. The users in this group were generally skeptical about whether they could trust the data and the way it was presented. The simple data visualisations, the commentary around the data on the website is designed to meet these needs.  

### Storyteller

These users want to influence the electorate by creating engaging narratives. Users in this group need to access data that tells an interesting story presented in a way that doesn’t allow for misinterpretation. Again, the simple and clear data visualisations and the commentary in plain english were developed with these needs in mind.

### Changemaker

These users want to encourage data-driven change to improve the lives of people and society. Changemakers are academics, researchers, data experts and experts from NGOs and think tanks. This group of users need easy access to the raw data and methodology in a format that they can use for analysis. The methodology section which explains  how the data was collected as well as the raw data downloads were developed to meet these needs.

The insights about the users and their needs are based on extensive research carried out from discovery through to beta.

## User research approach

From discovery through to beta we have used a range of research methods including:

Deep dive interviews 
“Day in the life of”
Usability labs
Task based testing
Focus groups
Pop-up research

Our choice of research method depended on our learning objectives at different stages of the project and followed our agile sprints. Stages of the project broadly followed the GDS service life-cycle; consisting of discovery, alpha and beta phases.

During discovery we wanted to learn who different users might be and what their goals, motivations and needs were. To get to those insights we used deep dive interviews including a day in the life of and card sorting exercises. 

In alpha we had weekly usability labs where we presented different user groups with a new version of the prototype. This rapid feedback enabled us to iterate the prototypes at pace and continue to test new options. 
  
During beta we continued the usability labs, reducing the frequency of these to fortnightly. We also carried out several focus groups and pop-up testing sessions. Furthermore, prior to releasing the public beta, we held a private beta during which we gave approximately 100 users from the different persona groups private access to the website. This allowed the users to explore the website in a more natural setting than in the usability labs. We received feedback on their experience in the form of diary studies, phone interviews and a survey. 

Across methodologies, we ensured that users we tested with were representative of the demographic mix that we expected of our final public audience after launch. Demographic factors that we considered included;  age, ethnicity and geography. We also included users with assisted digital or accessibility needs.  

## GOV.UK
The style of the website follows the GOV.UK style patterns. When we first started testing prototypes of the website it wasn’t certain whether the website would be on GOV.UK or have another home. Through testing with the users, we found that trust was a substantial need for all user groups and the GOV.UK brand resonated trust and authority with the users. Being part of GOV.UK has influenced our our tone of voice and design. See the sections on “How we write” and “Visualisations” for insights on our current practice. 
## Navigation
The navigation of the website has been developed to represent users’ mental models of the different topic areas as opposed to a departmental grouping of the topics. In the first prototypes of the website we tested different options and found that users were more likely to navigate by topic than by race or location. In the first prototype we tested a search bar the header. Users didn’t touch the search bar and when asked why they said that their experience with search bars was poor and they would be more likely to Google for the data they were looking for. We also tested different options to filter the data but we found that too many options created a confusing flow for users. That being said we do recognise that at a later point when there are more measures on Ethnicity facts and figures. However, for now we found that the best option for navigation is the six main topics with subtopics.  

The topics and subtopics were initially based on research of report in the field such as (...) The naming and ordering of topics and subtopics was continually changed throughout alpha and beta. Based on task based research in the lab we found that some of the measures were not under the subtopic users expected them to be and we continually rearranged these to make sure that the navigation to a measure page matched users mental model. When placing a measure under a subtopic or creating a new subtopic try to imagine how users will think of the subject in the measure as opposed to relying on which department the data comes from.
