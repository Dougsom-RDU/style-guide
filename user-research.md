## GOV.UK
The style of the website follows the GOV.UK style patterns. When we first started testing prototypes of the website it wasnâ€™t certain whether the website would be on GOV.UK or have another home. Through testing with the users, we found that trust was a substantial need for all user groups and the GOV.UK brand resonated trust and authority with the users.
