## Users and user needs  
## User research approach
## GOV.UK
The style of the website follows the GOV.UK style patterns. When we first started testing prototypes of the website it wasn’t certain whether the website would be on GOV.UK or have another home. Through testing with the users, we found that trust was a substantial need for all user groups and the GOV.UK brand resonated trust and authority with the users. Being part of GOV.UK has influenced our our tone of voice and design. See the sections on “How we write” and “Visualisations” for insights on our current practice. 
## Navigation
The navigation of the website has been developed to represent users’ mental models of the different topic areas as opposed to a departmental grouping of the topics. In the first prototypes of the website we tested different options and found that users were more likely to navigate by topic than by race or location. In the first prototype we tested a search bar the header. Users didn’t touch the search bar and when asked why they said that their experience with search bars was poor and they would be more likely to Google for the data they were looking for. We also tested different options to filter the data but we found that too many options created a confusing flow for users. That being said we do recognise that at a later point when there are more measures on Ethnicity facts and figures. However, for now we found that the best option for navigation is the six main topics with subtopics.  

The topics and subtopics were initially based on research of report in the field such as (...) The naming and ordering of topics and subtopics was continually changed throughout alpha and beta. Based on task based research in the lab we found that some of the measures were not under the subtopic users expected them to be and we continually rearranged these to make sure that the navigation to a measure page matched users mental model. When placing a measure under a subtopic or creating a new subtopic try to imagine how users will think of the subject in the measure as opposed to relying on which department the data comes from.
